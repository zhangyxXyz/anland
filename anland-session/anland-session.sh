#!/bin/bash
# anland-session — the per-user anland session inside the Linux container
# (installed by setupanlandx.sh):
#
#   1. session D-Bus at $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus: the system user bus when the
#      systemd user manager provides one, else a dbus-launch'd session bus
#      bound to the same path — apps (glycin/gtk sandboxed SVG loaders,
#      dconf, …) require a bus exactly there
#   2. the anland wayland socket linked into the user runtime dir as
#      wayland-anland — apps run with XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/<uid>
#      (writable) and still reach the compositor through the link
#   3. Xwayland -rootless -displayfd → the X server picks the first free
#      display number and reports it over a pipe (no lock-file races)
#   4. that number is published as ":N" in ~/.anlandx (removed on exit) —
#      clients do `export DISPLAY=$(cat ~/.anlandx)`
#   5. mini-wm runs on it (rootless Xwayland surfaces windows only with a
#      WM that redirects them; it also serves the daemon's resize/close
#      channel on $ANLAND_RUNTIME_DIR/anland-wm.sock)
#   6. the app-facing environment is published TWICE: as KEY=VALUE lines in
#      ~/.anlandx-env, and as the systemd user session environment
#      (systemctl --user set-environment) so that apps launched via
#      `systemd-run --user` inherit it and land in app.slice scopes
#   7. when either process exits the other is stopped and the script
#      fails, so the unit's Restart= brings the session back as a whole
#
# Overrides: ~/.config/anlandx.env (sourced) or unit Environment=:
#   ANLAND_RUNTIME_DIR   awl runtime dir as seen from the container. Convention:
#                        /run/anland — droidspaces bind-mounts the host runtime
#                        dir (daemon config "runtime_dir", default
#                        /data/local/tmp/awl) there; wayland-0 lives in it and
#                        the mini-wm socket is created in it, so the host daemon
#                        finds the socket under its own runtime_dir
#   WAYLAND_DISPLAY      socket name in it (default wayland-0; the app-facing
#                        name via the link is always wayland-anland)
#   ANLAND_WM_SOCK       mini-wm control socket (default <runtime dir>/anland-wm.sock)
#   ANLAND_XWAYLAND_ARGS extra Xwayland arguments
#   ANLAND_MINIWM        mini-wm binary (default: anland-miniwm next to this script)
