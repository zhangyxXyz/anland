/* awl_sc.cpp — SurfaceControl compositor backend (HWC path), see awl_sc.hpp.
 *
 * Layer SCs are created straight from the window (ASurfaceControl_
 * createFromWindow siblings — the device-verified shape): the window Surface
 * itself is the root of the layer tree and every wayland layer (root surface,
 * subsurfaces, popups, drag icon, cursor) is one sibling; wl stacking order is
 * pure setZOrder order over the siblings. SurfaceFlinger/HWC composites the
 * siblings; the daemon composites nothing.
 *
 * Every layer runs in one of three modes, decided per latched frame:
 *   SCANOUT  the client's dma-buf itself, forged into an AHardwareBuffer
 *            (awl_ahb), is latched with setBuffer — zero copy, HWC plane.
 *   EGL      the client's dma-buf is sampled by this backend's GLES context
 *            (forged AHB → EGLImage texture; the GPU does not care about the
 *            pitch) into a platform-allocated swapchain buffer attached to
 *            the SC — one GPU blit for THIS layer only.
 *   EGL_SHM  wl_shm content: the client's pool is uploaded straight into a
 *            GL texture (damage rect only, awl_surface_shm_begin/end — the
 *            logic layer neither copies nor queues shm) and blitted into the
 *            swapchain buffer like EGL.
 *
 * HWC scan-out precondition (QCOM SDM, source + device 2026-09-17): the
 * display HAL rebuilds a layer buffer's plane layout from its aligned width
 * through gralloc's own stride rule and gives THAT pitch to DRM — a buffer
 * whose real pitch is not a fixed point of the rule (e.g. 1024 px, which
 * gralloc pads to 1280) fails ADDFB2 and its plane shows nothing, while GPU
 * composition (and screencap) render it fine. SCANOUT is therefore gated by
 * awl_ahb_hwc_scanout_ok; everything else goes through a platform-allocated
 * target (gralloc picks the layout — trivially valid for HWC and for SF's
 * own GPU fallback).
 *
 * Two owners, one lock (sc_window::m):
 *
 *   event path (awl_sc_sync, from window_dirty on the client's dispatch /
 *   input threads, and from attach): owns the LAYER SC LIFECYCLE. It
 *   snapshots the logic layer's stack (get_layers + cursor_layer — the same
 *   kwin below→surface→above traversal the hit-test uses), creates an SC for
 *   every layer that entered the stack, retires the SC of every layer that
 *   left it, and reassigns z = traversal index, all in ONE transaction. So an
 *   SC lives exactly as long as its surface is part of an attached window's
 *   tree — created the moment get_subsurface/get_popup/set_cursor links it,
 *   gone the moment the surface/role/link dies — never a frame later, never
 *   from the render thread. It never touches GL: GL objects a retired layer
 *   owned are handed to the render thread (g_gc).
 *
 *   render thread (choreographer vsync loop, one for all windows, owner of
 *   the backend's GLES context): owns only BUFFER STATE. Per layer: queue
 *   lock → drain → tryhead (never waits: an unsignaled acquire fence leaves
 *   the previous buffer AND its geometry on screen; the fence is watched in
 *   the looper and the layer re-checked the moment it signals, or at the
 *   next vsync — one client's GPU must not stall every window) → arm →
 *   unlock; a NEW frame is latched in its mode. No dmabuf frame → the shm
 *   source is asked. The layer geometry (position/scale/crop/transform/
 *   opacity) is applied in the SAME transaction as the buffer: it is a
 *   function of the latched buffer's dimensions and wl_surface.commit is
 *   atomic — buffer and geometry of one commit must land in one SF frame,
 *   so a pass that cannot latch the newest frame does not move the layer
 *   either (the logic layer's geometry already describes that frame).
 *
 * Pacing (measured against the GL path with vkmark, 2026-09-17):
 *   - frame_done goes out at the vsync TICK for every visible layer, from
 *     the render thread — not from SF's OnComplete (one vsync later: a
 *     frame-callback-paced client then ran at 29 fps) and not at the off-tick
 *     apply (a callback per vsync is the contract).
 *   - a commit wakes the render thread for one off-tick pass per window per
 *     interval, so a paced client's frame reaches SF's next composition
 *     instead of waiting for our tick (GL-path latency parity). A GPU
 *     client's frame is still on the GPU at that moment; the pass then
 *     watches its acquire fence (looper fd) and the apply happens when the
 *     fence signals — the interval's off-tick slot is consumed by the pass
 *     that applies, not by the one that found nothing latchable.
 *   - a client that keeps running ahead of the vsync (mailbox/immediate) is
 *     copied (EGL mode) instead of scanned out: zero-copy would leave it
 *     with no free buffer (SF holds three, the queue head a fourth) and one
 *     frame per vsync (123 fps vs 1300 copying). See sc_rlayer::overspeed.
 *
 * Layer removal contract (NDK surface_control.h): ASurfaceControl_release
 * only drops our reference — "the surface and its children may remain on
 * display as long as their parent remains on display". Under a live
 * SurfaceView parent a released-but-not-reparented layer keeps showing its
 * last buffer forever (device dumpsys 2026-09-17: generations of
 * `handleNotAlive` awl-layers stacked at z=1..3 under the SurfaceView). A
 * layer therefore leaves through hide + reparent(NULL) in a transaction, and
 * the reference is dropped only after that transaction is applied.
 *
 * Release chains — whatever is latched on an SC stays referenced until SF is
 * done with it:
 *   SCANOUT: the queue element. 36+ (dlsym) setBufferWithRelease gives a
 *   per-buffer OnRelease carrying the release fence → awl_bufferqueue_put
 *   (elem, fence) → bq_release_cb (esync fenced_release / implicit dma-buf
 *   reservation / wl_buffer.release). 29..35: the transaction's OnComplete
 *   stats give the PREVIOUS buffer's release fence per SC — each setBuffer
 *   (B2 over B1) parks B1 in the transaction context.
 *   EGL/EGL_SHM: the swapchain slot, same two mechanisms (slot goes back to
 *   its pool with SF's fence, GPU-waited before it is drawn into again). The
 *   source element of an EGL frame is put with the blit's native fence right
 *   away — the client gets its buffer back as soon as the GPU read it.
 * Contexts hold only acquired ASurfaceControls, queue-referenced elements,
 * shared_ptrs to pools and surface ids — no window pointers, a detached
 * window cannot dangle them. */
