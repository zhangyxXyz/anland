/* awl_bufferqueue.h — per-surface buffer ring queue: the mediator between
 * the protocol dispatch thread (producer: commits) and the window's render
 * thread (consumer: frames).
 *
 * Pure Linux (dma-buf fd + sync_file fd + plain integers): no libwayland, no
 * Android objects — the logic layer feeds it, the adaptation layer drains it,
 * neither side sees the other's types. This is the seam a hardware-composer
 * backend plugs into later (it consumes the same elements).
 *
 * Model (mailbox + per-element references):
 *   push    lock-free, any thread. Fails when the ring is full (the caller
 *           must hand the buffer straight back to its owner).
 *   drain   caller holds the head lock. Pops the head while the element
 *           behind it is already complete (its acquire fence signaled —
 *           completion is assumed FIFO: an element is complete only if every
 *           earlier one is). Afterwards the head is the newest complete
 *           element (or the oldest incomplete one when none is complete yet).
 *           A popped element drops the ring's reference; it goes back to the
 *           producer (release callback) when the last reference is gone.
 *   gethead caller holds the head lock. Waits (bounded) for the head's
 *           acquire fence, takes a reference on it and returns it — the
 *           caller may UNLOCK IMMEDIATELY: the element stays valid (and its
 *           dma-buf open) until the caller's awl_bufferqueue_put, however far
 *           the ring moves meanwhile. The lock is held for microseconds; a
 *           commit-time drain almost never misses.
 *   put     any thread, no lock: the consumer is done with an element it
 *           got from gethead. fence_fd (sync_file, may be -1) = when the
 *           consumer's reads of that memory are finished — merged into the
 *           element's release fence, handed to the producer when the last
 *           reference drops (explicit-sync fenced_release / implicit-sync
 *           read fence in the dma-buf reservation).
 *   arm     caller holds the lock, after drain: when the frame behind the
 *           head is still incomplete, a shared fence-waiter thread drains
 *           the queue the moment its acquire fence signals — a producer
 *           parked on buffer starvation is unblocked when its own GPU work
 *           finishes, not at the next commit or the next vsync.
 *   lock/trylock/unlock  head lock. The render thread holds it across
 *           drain+gethead only; the dispatch thread trylocks at commit for
 *           an opportunistic drain and passes when it is busy.
 *
 * Elements own their fds: the queue closes dmabuf/acquire/release fds once the
 * release callback returned. `user` is an opaque producer cookie handed to the
 * callback (the logic layer keeps its wl_buffer/release-object bookkeeping
 * there). A dmabuf_fd of -1 is a NULL-buffer marker ("no dmabuf frame from
 * here on": wl_surface.attach(NULL) commit, or a wl_shm commit following
 * dmabuf ones): always "complete", the consumer shows no dmabuf for that
 * layer and asks the logic layer for shm content instead (awl.h
 * awl_surface_shm_begin). wl_shm frames never enter a queue.
 *
 * Lifetime: refcounted. The owning surface holds one reference; every live
 * element holds one (so the queue outlives its owner while a consumer still
 * holds a frame); a consumer resolving the queue takes its own for the span
 * it touches the ring. */
