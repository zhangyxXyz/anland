/* awl_surface.c — wl_compositor / wl_surface (double-buffered) / wl_region (v2)
 *
 * commit flow: pending→current → first frame (window not yet created)
 * triggers window_created + migration of the client to a dedicated event
 * thread; each commit calls window_dirty directly (adapter implementations
 * must be thread safe: internally these are renderer requests with
 * built-in coalescing).
 *
 * Buffer hand-off (v3, awl_bufferqueue.h): a dmabuf commit does not hand
 * the renderer a pointer to "the current buffer" — it pushes the frame
 * (dup'd dmabuf fd + acquire fence) into the surface's queue and the
 * renderer pulls the newest complete one. wl_buffer.release and the
 * explicit-sync release go out when a frame leaves the queue (bq_release_cb
 * below), from whichever thread drained it: the render thread at frame
 * time, or this dispatch thread right at commit (opportunistic trylock
 * drain — over-speed clients get their buffers back without waiting for
 * vsync). A wl_shm commit is not queued and not copied: it only records the
 * source + accumulates damage; the backend reads the client's pool in place
 * at frame time (awl_surface_shm_begin/end, section at the end) and the
 * release goes out when that read is done.
 *
 * Locks: list topology = g_srv.rwl (dispatch thread wr, others rd);
 *        surface fields/sends = s->ev_lock (recursive); order rwl → ev_lock
 *        → g_bufref_lock (leaf, buffer liveness).
