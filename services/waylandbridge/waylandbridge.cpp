/* waylandbridge.cpp — root ELF daemon (core of the new architecture)
 *
 * Launched by su -c / SukiSU module service.sh; a native root resident
 * process — out of reach of OPlus Hans-style app freezing (background
 * kills only target app uids).
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - wayland host (logic layer) + GPU rendering (renderer; all resources
 *     held by the daemon)
 *   - window state table: alive (wayland window exists) / attached
 *     (Activity holds a surface)
 *   - Attach = am start AwlWindowActivity(libawl, --el id) (bring-to-front if
 *     already present)
 *   - single-attach model (APK only reports facts; all decisions in the
 *     daemon):
 *       SURFACE  id,w,h,Surface parcel,death token[,host] (render target;
 *                re-attach auto-evicts the old holder → orders it to kill
 *                itself via the old ctrl; single foreground)
 *       PAUSE    id[,host] (onPause → daemon fully detaches, ONEWAY)
 *       RESIZE   id,w,h
 *       LIST     → window list (id,title,attached)
 *       BRING    id → am start (list tap; SURFACE re-sent on onResume is
 *                the re-attach)
 *       CLOSE    id → graceful client exit (list long-press menu, the
 *                sole window-close entry)
 *   - APP abnormal death: AIBinder_linkToDeath(death token) → kernel
 *     callback auto-detaches all windows of that process (minimize
 *     semantics, wayland window kept alive)
 *   - window_destroyed (client quit on its own) → immediate forced full
 *     detach + close notification: C_CLOSE over ctrl to an ATTACHED
 *     (active) holder → it finishes. A PAUSED holder is fully detached
 *     already (every detach drops every binder of the window, ctrl
 *     included) and is deliberately NOT chased: it keeps its last frame
 *     and exits on its own at resume, when the re-attach SURFACE is
 *     rejected (no such window → rc -1 → finish). The WINDOW_GONE
 *     broadcast stays as the host-APK-only fallback for a failed ctrl
 *     send. Note the ctrl object is owned by the Activity: the daemon
 *     releasing its proxy is invisible to the Activity (death recipients
 *     fire only on process death), so an explicit C_CLOSE is the only
 *     daemon → active-holder close signal.
 *   - window events (T_SUBSCRIBE): created/destroyed/attached/detached
 *     pushed to subscriber apps over their own binder; unauthenticated
 *     apps receive only their own uid's windows; a paused subscriber is
 *     disconnected automatically (its own report, binder death, failed
 *     send, or the oom_score_adj watchdog)
 *   - wayland connections over binder (T_CONNECT, #36): an app sends one
 *     end of its own socketpair and connects wl_display_connect_to_fd on
 *     the other — no wayland-0 socket file needed (config "socket_listen"
 *     0 disables listening entirely; the fd's SO_PEERCRED still carries
 *     the caller's uid/pid, so per-window ownership checks are unchanged)
